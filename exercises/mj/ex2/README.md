# Barnes-Hut with OpenMP parallelise
In this exercise we have done a simulation of n-body using the leapfrog method and Barnes-Hut algorigthm with OpenMP parallelise.
I have done geometry, particle, Barnes-Hut (bh) modules and ex2 program. Also, I have done a Makefile. Moreover, I have done CI program to generate random inicial conditions. Particle module is the same as in exercise 1, but I have added some operators in geometry module as I need them in the Barnes-Hut module. 

Using this program I have done a simulation of 40 bodys, with a time of simulation of 4.42 seconds.
